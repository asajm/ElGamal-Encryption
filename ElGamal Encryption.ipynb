    "\n",
    "ElGamal encryption, devised by Taher ElGamal in 1985, is a public-key cryptosystem based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange. It’s among the earliest of cryptosystems that are theoretically secure against ciphertext attacks. In this project, we will discuss the theoretical background of ElGamal encryption, its importance and applications, and provide some examples and computations.\n"

    "## Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "ElGamal encryption depends on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithms within a cyclic group. In cyclic groups, every element has an inverse, and the product of any two elements is also an element of the group. ElGamal encryption provides a secure way to transmit encrypted messages over an unsecured channel. The scheme involves key generation, encryption, and decryption processes."

    "### Key Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The key generation process involves selecting a cyclic group and a generator for that group. Let's consider a finite cyclic group $G=\\mathbb{Z_p^*}$ of order $p$, where $p$ is a large prime number. The generator $g$ of $G$ is a randomly chosen element. Each user generates their key pair consisting of a private key, $x$ (randomly selected from $\\{1,2,...,p-1\\}$), and a corresponding public key, $y = g^x \\mod p$."
