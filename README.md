# ElGamal Encryption
ElGamal encryption, devised by Taher ElGamal in 1985, is a public-key cryptosystem based on the Diffie–Hellman key exchange. It’s among the earliest of cryptosystems that are theoretically secure against ciphertext attacks. In this project, we will discuss the theoretical background of ElGamal encryption, its importance and applications, and provide some examples and computations.
